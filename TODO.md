## Ideas to implement

- Extract spacing and more values into theme - currently there are only colors and font-sizes. Plus using
  styled-system, so the usage of them would be easier and faster

- Use Emotion Object Styles API instead of string literal - more readable, comfortable and error proof

- Add some graphQL parsing library to improve Developer Experience

- Articles count is the overall one - there could be additional information how many are actually
  visible (and update it while filtering by Search field)

- Search can be reset when changing the route - matter of UX preferences

- Add data-test-id for components, which could be later used in tests

- Update the endpoint based on environment variable - as currently application works only in development mode

- Animation for "Add to cart" button on click
